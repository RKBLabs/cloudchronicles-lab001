A structured STAR-based disaster recovery plan can help mitigate the impact of the Google Cloud us-central1 outage while ensuring business continuity. Below is an approach following the STAR framework (Situation, Task, Action, Result), leveraging Google Cloud tools for failover and recovery:

Situation
A regional outage has occurred in us-central1, affecting services like Cloud SQL databases, storage, and application availability. The goal is to minimize downtime and restore service efficiently.

Task
Develop a disaster recovery strategy using Google Cloud’s multi-region capabilities to ensure service resilience. The plan should include database failover, storage availability, and real-time monitoring.

Action
To ensure rapid failover, implement the following steps:

Database Failover – Cloud SQL Replicas

Maintain read replicas in other regions (e.g., us-east1 or us-west1) to handle the load.

Set up automated Cloud SQL failover with high availability (HA) enabled.

Promote a replica as the new primary if the original fails, minimizing downtime.

Multi-Region Storage – Cloud Storage

Use multi-region Cloud Storage buckets to store critical assets.

Ensure asynchronous replication across regions to preserve data integrity.

Applications should automatically switch to another region’s storage endpoint if us-central1 is unavailable.

Pub/Sub Alerts for Monitoring

Enable Cloud Monitoring & Pub/Sub notifications to detect outages.

Set up alerts to trigger automated recovery workflows, such as database failover or resource scaling.

Integrate with Cloud Functions to initiate backup processes when an outage occurs.

Traffic Routing – Load Balancing & CDN

Utilize Google Cloud Load Balancers to redirect traffic to healthy regions.

Implement Cloud CDN for caching, reducing latency during recovery.
